# COVID-19 X-ray Image Classifier

This repository contains code for an image classifier that can recognize COVID-19 in X-ray images using deep learning techniques. Please note that this code is meant for educational purposes only and should not be used in a real-world medical setting without proper evaluation and validation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation should be organized in the following structure:

dataset/
├── train/
│ ├── covid19/
│ │ ├── covid_image_1.jpg
│ │ ├── covid_image_2.jpg
│ │ └── ...
│ └── non_covid19/
│ ├── non_covid_image_1.jpg
│ ├── non_covid_image_2.jpg
│ └── ...
└── validation/
├── covid19/
│ ├── covid_image_1.jpg
│ ├── covid_image_2.jpg
│ └── ...
└── non_covid19/
├── non_covid_image_1.jpg
├── non_covid_image_2.jpg
└── ...


You need to update the `dataset_path` variable in the code with the path to your dataset directory.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- Python 3.x

To install the required dependencies, you can use pip:

**pip install tensorflow**

## Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-Akshay/covid19-xray-classifier.git

Set the dataset path:

Open the `xray_classifier.py` file and update the `dataset_path` variable with the path to your dataset directory.

Run the script:

**python xray_classifier.py**

4. Monitor the training progress and evaluate the model's performance.
